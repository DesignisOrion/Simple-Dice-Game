# Simple Dice Game

**Version 1.0.0 **

This program is a game called " Simple Dice Game".

This game allows the user to roll dice against the computer. The goal is to get a higher number than the computer generated at random. This game allowed me to explore more with the random library, but also introduce the time library. Enjoy!
